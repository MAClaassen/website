Humans have a fascination with quantifying behaviors. While numbers can provide intriguing insights, they can also distort public perceptions and misguide policy design. This article deconstructs the popular belief that individuals make 200 mindless food-related decisions a day, offering alternative perspectives on the conceptualization and measurement of food decisions. Specifically, we argue that existing decision-making theories offer limited guidance in defining and measuring such decisions, and advocate for more precise operationalizations. We emphasize the need for contextual understanding over simplistic numerical representations, propose a comprehensive working definition of food decisions, and consider alternative methods that may be better suited to capturing the complexity and nuance of food decisions. To conclude, we advocate for methodological pluralism in studying food decisions.
