However, this research tends to be correlational, and thus it is unclear whether inducing people to think about their future could increase healthy eating. Therefore, we investigated whether inducing people to think about their lives in the future versus the present would influence their intake of healthy (muesli) and unhealthy (Maltesers) food. Across two experiments, the effect of thinking about the future versus the present interacted with participants’ body mass index (BMI) to influence their consumption of unhealthy food, but no reliable effects were found for the consumption of healthy food. Among individuals with a higher BMI, thinking about their lives in the future resulted in lower consumption of the unhealthy food compared to thinking about their lives in the present. However, this effect was reversed for those with a lower BMI. In Experiment 2, we found no evidence that this effect was due to reduced impulsivity (as measured by a delay discounting task and a stop-signal task). This suggests that thinking about the future can reduce unhealthy eating among heavier people.","tags":null,"title":"The time is ripe - Thinking about the future reduces unhealthy eating in those with a higher BMI","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.A. Claassen","O.

Yet, there is little conclusive evidence about the mechanisms driving this association. In this systematic review, we discuss and compare the results of 22 studies that examine the role of psychosocial mediators in the association between SES and BMI in diverse population samples. These include factors related to resources and constraints in one's external neighborhood, social resources, and psychological factors such as stress. The findings support theoretical models indicating that SES is related to BMI partially through environmental and psychological factors. Importantly, SES often remains a significant predictor of weight status, indicating the importance of also addressing structural antecedents in order to improve health among lower SES populations. We thoroughly discuss the quality and limitations of current study designs and mediation testing and provide recommendations for future research.","tags":null,"title":"A systematic review of psychosocial explanations for the relationship between socioeconomic status and body mass index","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
