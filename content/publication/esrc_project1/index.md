abstract: Consumers’ daily water consumption remains below the recommended level, possibly because of more rewarding alternatives such as sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). Previous research has shown that taste and reward expectations play a key role in food and drink choices, and that thinking about drinks in terms of consuming and enjoying them (i.e., simulations) predicts desire and intake. Here, we examined whether labels using consumption and reward simulation words increased the appeal of water. In three pre-registered experiments with regular consumers of SSBs (N = 1355), we presented water labels with words related to the rewarding consumption experience of water (e.g., “refreshing”, “cool”), with conventional descriptions of water that emphasised its origin and purity, or with brand names only. We assessed participants’ anticipated reward of and desire for water (Exp. 1, 2, 3), simulations of drinking water, and water attractiveness (Exp. 2 and 3). Contrary to our expectations, waters with consumption and reward-focused labels were not rated more favourably than waters with conventional labels, but both were rated higher than brand-only labels. Our findings suggest that the appeal of water cannot easily be increased by emphasising the rewarding consumption experience through language only. Consumers may have a relatively fixed representation of what water tastes and feels like, and future research could test alternative approaches to increase water consumption among SSB consumers.
