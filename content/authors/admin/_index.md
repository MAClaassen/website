Hi! I'm Almudena Claassen and I completed my PhD in 2019 at the Université libre de Bruxelles in Belgium. There I examined the influence of socioeconomic status on impulsivity and eating behavior. I joined the Healthy Cognition Lab of the University of Glasgow in 2020 where I worked on an ESRC grant examining the role of consumption and reward simulations in the motivation for sugar-sweetened beverages and water. I am currently working at the Center for Adaptive Rationality at MPI Berlin where I am researching eating decisions and ways to boost healthier ones. I use experimental methods and am  passionate about programming and data analysis.
